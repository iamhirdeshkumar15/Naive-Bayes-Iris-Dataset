# Naive-Bayes-Iris-Dataset
A Naive Bayes classification project using the Iris dataset. This R script demonstrates how to apply the Naive Bayes algorithm for species prediction, including feature scaling and accuracy assessment through a confusion matrix.

## Project Overview
This project applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to the famous Iris dataset to classify iris species based on sepal and petal measurements. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling is applied for better model performance.
